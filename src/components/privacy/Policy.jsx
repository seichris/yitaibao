The Smart Contracts and the website are collectively referred to in this Policy as the “App”. By using the App, you agree to the way we process your information as described in this Policy. This Policy only applies to the App, and not to any other websites, products or services you may be able to access or link to via the App. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any other websites you visit before providing your information to them.
